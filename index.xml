I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer living in London, currently working for Credit Kudos. Previously I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in San Francisco working for Bitnami and Loopup, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina where I worked at the Comprensive Cancer Center doing some interesting cancer informatics stuff.
In my free time I like skydiving, paragliding, hiking, photography and reading/ writing. Feel free to reach out at:

The key idea is that you journal every day, and must write (at least) 750 words, or around 3 pages. I’d been journaling on and off in a paper journal for a year at that point, generally maxing out at one or two entries a month. Trying to bring a little more rigour to my approach was appealing, so I figured I’d give it a go for a week and see what happens.</description></item></channel></rss>

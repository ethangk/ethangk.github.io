They’re final-year paramedic students, weeks away from graduating and stepping into the real world. There’s been a question floating around my head that I’ve had trouble defining until I sat down to write this post. It’s whether bravery can be taught. Not learned, but taught. I asked them if their course has changed them, and they all emphatically agreed, saying that they can keep a far cooler head under pressure, and feel comfortable running towards the chaos, vs away from it.</description></item><item><title>May 2021</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/may2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/may2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Saying the difficult things</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/saying-difficult-things/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 12:10:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/saying-difficult-things/</guid><description>During the summer last year, I was doing my annual big hike with a friend. We use these hikes to see more of the country, and inevitably the conversations end up covering every topic under the sun. That day, we’d been talking about communication. In the evening, tucked away in a little cabin near Glencoe, something was rolling around in my head that I couldn’t quite pin down. For the longest time, I’d told myself that I was open to feedback and hard conversations because I’d repeatedly said to people that I’m always happy to hear it.</description></item><item><title>Now</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 10:23:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/now/</guid><description>This is a now page
Heading North I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of moving to Sheffield. Over the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself craving being closer to the outdoors. I&amp;rsquo;m going to give it a trial for 6 months before deciding what makes sense for me. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to do more outdoorsy hobbies, and attempt to integrate and actively participate in community, something I&amp;rsquo;ve had difficulty finding in London.</description></item><item><title>April 2021</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/apr2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/apr2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 20:23:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/about/</guid><description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer living in London, currently working for Credit Kudos.

The key idea is that you journal every day, and must write (at least) 750 words, or around 3 pages. I’d been journaling on and off in a paper journal for a year at that point, generally maxing out at one or two entries a month. Trying to bring a little more rigour to my approach was appealing, so I figured I’d give it a go for a week and see what happens.</description></item><item><title>February 2021</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/feb2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/feb2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>January 2021</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/jan2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/jan2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>December 2020</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/dec2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/dec2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>November 2020</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/nov2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/nov2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>October 2020</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/oct2020/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/oct2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>September 2020</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/sep2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/sep2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>August 2020</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/aug2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/aug2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>July 2020</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/jul2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/jul2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>June 2020</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/jun2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/jun2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>May 2020</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/may2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2020 23:46:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/potm/may2020/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>

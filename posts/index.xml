There was a thread on Reddit, and the top response was “If you’re asking this, you’re probably already there”. That stuck with me. With some examination, the questions I’m asking sometimes tell me more than the answers I receive.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself at times Googling &amp;ldquo;Books to change your life&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>EMDR and Meditation</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/emdr-meditation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 10:10:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/emdr-meditation/</guid><description>Towards the middle of last year, I decided to give EMDR a try, after hitting what felt like an impassable wall in traditional talk therapy. It was incredibly helpful for me, although not the magic bullet I was hoping it&amp;rsquo;d be. But what I did take away from it was the ability to hold onto and connect with the fleeting images in my head that came up during the sessions.</description></item><item><title>Teaching Bravery</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/teaching-bravery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 12:10:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/teaching-bravery/</guid><description>On a warm evening recently I was talking with my neighbours over a beer. They’re final-year paramedic students, weeks away from graduating and stepping into the real world. There’s been a question floating around my head that I’ve had trouble defining until I sat down to write this post. It’s whether bravery can be taught. Not learned, but taught. I asked them if their course has changed them, and they all emphatically agreed, saying that they can keep a far cooler head under pressure, and feel comfortable running towards the chaos, vs away from it.</description></item><item><title>Saying the difficult things</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/saying-difficult-things/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 12:10:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/saying-difficult-things/</guid><description>During the summer last year, I was doing my annual big hike with a friend. We use these hikes to see more of the country, and inevitably the conversations end up covering every topic under the sun. That day, we’d been talking about communication. In the evening, tucked away in a little cabin near Glencoe, something was rolling around in my head that I couldn’t quite pin down. For the longest time, I’d told myself that I was open to feedback and hard conversations because I’d repeatedly said to people that I’m always happy to hear it.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on (roughly) 750,000 words</title><link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/750-words/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 12:10:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/750-words/</guid><description>In May 2018, I stumbled upon Buster Benson’s site, where he discusses the Morning Pages idea and journaling for 750 words. The key idea is that you journal every day, and must write (at least) 750 words, or around 3 pages. I’d been journaling on and off in a paper journal for a year at that point, generally maxing out at one or two entries a month. Trying to bring a little more rigour to my approach was appealing, so I figured I’d give it a go for a week and see what happens.</description></item></channel></rss>

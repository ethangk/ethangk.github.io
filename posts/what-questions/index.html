There was a thread on Reddit, and the top response was “If you’re asking this, you’re probably already there”. That stuck with me. With some examination, the questions I’m asking sometimes tell me more than the answers I receive.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve found myself at times Googling &ldquo;Books to change your life&rdquo;.

They’re final-year paramedic students, weeks away from graduating and stepping into the real world. There’s been a question floating around my head that I’ve had trouble defining until I sat down to write this post. It’s whether bravery can be taught. Not learned, but taught. I asked them if their course has changed them, and they all emphatically agreed, saying that they can keep a far cooler head under pressure, and feel comfortable running <em>towards</em> the chaos, vs away from it. The question that remains for me, though, is whether that’d actually apply to unfamiliar circumstances. I’m reminded of a quote from Game Of Thrones:</p><blockquote><p>“Bran thought about it. ‘Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid?’
‘That is the only time a man can be brave,’ his father told him.”</p></blockquote><p>I don’t think familiarity and exposure to a certain kind of situation necessarily equals bravery. If you don’t feel fear whilst doing something ostensibly ‘scary’, does doing that thing really make you brave? I’ve been skydiving for a few years now, and the fear wore off around 20 jumps in. There’s no longer any ‘door fear’, just excitement before I jump. Learning to skydive has given me something to draw on when telling myself that I <em>can</em> do something I’m scared of because I’ve done it before. But there’s still plenty of things that terrify me, which I shirk away from instead of doing.</p><p>This brings me to the title of this post. After moving back to the UK I went through a phase of wanting to join the military, as it’d push me into situations that scare me. Ultimately I decided against joining, for various reasons, but I think that was a good thing. I don’t think it would have given me what I wanted. I wanted to outsource the hard work of learning to face things that scare me. And I don’t think anyone can teach me that.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><a href=/posts/saying-difficult-things/ class="post-nav prev">← Saying the difficult things</a>

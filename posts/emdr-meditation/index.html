It was incredibly helpful for me, although not the magic bullet I was hoping it&rsquo;d be. But what I did take away from it was the ability to hold onto and connect with the fleeting images in my head that came up during the sessions.</p><p>A few months ago I picked up meditating again. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve tried on and off with varying degrees of success over the years. But this time around I&rsquo;ve found it easier to connect to what I&rsquo;m feeling. My approach isn&rsquo;t drastically different from what I&rsquo;ve tried in the past, but the introspection part has seemingly clicked, albeit in fits and starts. This evening I was thinking about someone who&rsquo;d been important in my past, someone who I&rsquo;ve tried to not think of over the past few years, and felt a strong emotional reaction to thinking about them. I figured that I might get somewhere by meditating on that feeling, and I was surprised by how strong a physical and emotional reaction I had. It felt comparable to the hardest (and most effective) EMDR sessions that I had, although this time without a therapist to talk it through with. It felt like something was fighting to get out, and it almost did but I couldn&rsquo;t quite let go.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure where I&rsquo;m going with this. Feedback to a previous post was that I got close to the point, but didn&rsquo;t quite get there. Perhaps it&rsquo;s that if you&rsquo;ve dabbled with meditation in the past, and have tried EMDR (and found it helpful) to consider giving meditation another go.</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>29.

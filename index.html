There was a thread on Reddit, and the top response was “If you’re asking this, you’re probably already there”. That stuck with me. With some examination, the questions I’m asking sometimes tell me more than the answers I receive.</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>09.

They’re final-year paramedic students, weeks away from graduating and stepping into the real world. There’s been a question floating around my head that I’ve had trouble defining until I sat down to write this post. It’s whether bravery can be taught. Not learned, but taught.

We use these hikes to see more of the country, and inevitably the conversations end up covering every topic under the sun. That day, we’d been talking about communication. In the evening, tucked away in a little cabin near Glencoe, something was rolling around in my head that I couldn’t quite pin down. For the longest time, I’d told myself that I was open to feedback and hard conversations because I’d repeatedly said to people that I’m always happy to hear it. …</p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>06.
